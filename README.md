# Decision-Tree

Constructed a decision tree using ID3 Algorithm to learn data from examples that holds some distinct binary features(chemical solutions
for the provided sample train.data) and assigned a binary output lable(quality lowToMid or MidToHigh for this sample). Then predict
possible outputs according to the d-tree. 
Accuracy: 89%
